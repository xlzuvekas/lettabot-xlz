# Skills

Skills extend your LettaBot agent with CLI tools and specialized knowledge. They follow the open [Agent Skills](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/skills) standard used by Letta Code, Cursor, Claude Code, and other compatible agents.

This document covers how skills work within lettabot specifically -- directory hierarchy, feature-gated installation, the SKILL.md format, and how to author new skills.

## How skills work

Skills go through two phases:

1. **Installation** -- Feature-gated skills (scheduling, Google, voice memo) are automatically copied to the agent's skill directory based on config flags in `lettabot.yaml`. Non-feature-gated skills are discovered directly from the directory hierarchy.
2. **Runtime** -- When a session starts, skill directories containing executables are prepended to `PATH` so the agent can invoke them as CLI tools.

## Directory hierarchy

LettaBot scans these directories in priority order. Same-name skills at higher priority override lower ones:

| Priority | Path | Scope | Description |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 (highest) | `.skills/` | Project | Skills specific to this lettabot project |
| 2 | `~/.letta/agents/{id}/skills/` | Agent | Skills for one specific agent |
| 3 | `~/.letta/skills/` | Global | Shared across all agents on this machine |
| 4 | `skills/` (in lettabot repo) | Bundled | Ships with lettabot |
| 5 (lowest) | `~/.agents/skills/` | skills.sh | Installed via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) |

Feature-gated skills are copied from source directories into the agent-scoped directory (`~/.letta/agents/{id}/skills/`) when a session is first acquired. The copy is idempotent -- skills already present in the target are skipped.

## Feature-gated skills

Some skills are only installed when their corresponding feature is enabled in `lettabot.yaml`:

| Config flag | Skills installed | Purpose |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| `features.cron: true` | `scheduling` | Cron jobs and one-off reminders via `lettabot-schedule` |
| `integrations.google.enabled: true` or `polling.gmail.enabled: true` | `gog`, `google` | Google Workspace and Gmail integration |
| TTS provider configured (ElevenLabs or OpenAI key set) | `voice-memo` | Voice memo replies via `lettabot-tts` |

The mapping from config flags to skill names lives in `FEATURE_SKILLS` in `src/skills/loader.ts`. The code also supports passing explicit skill names programmatically via `additionalSkills` in `SkillsInstallConfig`.

## SKILL.md format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a body written for the agent (not humans). The body is loaded into the agent's context when the skill is relevant -- it's a prompt, not documentation.

```markdown
---
name: scheduling
description: Create scheduled tasks and one-off reminders.
---

# Scheduling

(Agent-facing instructions: CLI usage, when to use the skill, examples, constraints...)
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier (must be unique within its scope) |
| `description` | No | Brief description shown to the agent |
| `emoji` | No | Display emoji |
| `homepage` | No | URL for the skill's homepage or docs |
| `metadata` | No | JSON-encoded object with a `clawdbot` key (see below) |

### ClawdBot metadata

The `metadata` field can contain a JSON-encoded `clawdbot` object for requirements and install specs:

```yaml
metadata: >-
  {"clawdbot": {
    "emoji": "📦",
    "requires": {"bins": ["mycli"], "env": ["MY_API_KEY"]},
    "install": [{"kind": "brew", "formula": "mycli"}]
  }}
```

**`requires`** -- prerequisites for the skill to be eligible:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `bins` | `string[]` | All of these binaries must exist on PATH |
| `anyBins` | `string[]` | At least one of these must exist |
| `env` | `string[]` | Required environment variables |

Run `lettabot skills status` to see which skills are eligible and which have missing binaries, environment variables, or platform mismatches.

**`install`** -- how to install dependencies (tried in order, filtered by platform):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | `'brew' \| 'node' \| 'go' \| 'uv' \| 'download'` | Package manager |
| `formula` | `string` | Homebrew formula (for `brew`) |
| `package` | `string` | npm/uv package name (for `node`/`uv`) |
| `module` | `string` | Go module path (for `go`) |
| `url` | `string` | Download URL (for `download`) |
| `bins` | `string[]` | Binaries this installs |
| `os` | `string[]` | Platform filter (`darwin`, `linux`, `win32`) |
| `label` | `string` | Display label for the install option |

**Other metadata fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `os` | `string[]` | Restrict skill to these platforms |
| `always` | `boolean` | Always eligible regardless of requirements |
| `skillKey` | `string` | Override the skill's key identifier |
| `primaryEnv` | `string` | Primary environment variable for the skill |

## Skill execution

When a session starts, `prependSkillDirsToPath()` in `src/skills/loader.ts` prepends skill directories to `PATH` immediately before `createSession`/`resumeSession` is called. The SDK spawns the Letta Code subprocess at session-creation time, so the subprocess inherits the augmented PATH at fork. Two sources are combined:

1. **Agent-scoped skills** (`~/.letta/agents/{id}/skills/`) — feature-gated skills installed by `installSkillsToAgent()` on startup.
2. **Working-dir skills** (`WORKING_DIR/.skills/`) — skills enabled via `lettabot skills enable <name>` or the interactive `lettabot skills` wizard.

Only directories containing at least one non-`.md` file are added. The prepend is idempotent — directories already on PATH are not duplicated. PATH is not restored after the call; the augmented PATH persists for the lifetime of the process, which is correct because the subprocess retains its inherited environment.

To verify skill directories are present after startup, check the child subprocess's `/proc/[pid]/environ` (not the parent lettabot process, which shares the same augmented PATH).

## Bundled skills

LettaBot ships with two built-in skills in the `skills/` directory:

- **scheduling** -- Create recurring cron jobs and one-off reminders via the `lettabot-schedule` CLI. Enabled by `features.cron: true`. See [Cron Setup](./cron-setup.md) for details.
- **voice-memo** -- Reply with voice notes using the `<voice>` directive and `lettabot-tts` CLI. Enabled when a TTS provider (ElevenLabs or OpenAI) is configured.

## Installing external skills

Use the interactive CLI to discover and enable skills:

```bash
# Interactive skill selector
lettabot skills

# Enable/disable skills from Clawdhub, skills.sh, and built-in sources
lettabot skills sync

# Check status of all discovered skills
lettabot skills status
```

External skill sources:

- [Clawdhub](https://clawdhub.com/) -- `npx clawdhub@latest install <skill>`
- [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) -- community skill repositories

See the [Letta Code skills documentation](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/skills) for the general skill installation flow and additional skill sources.

## Authoring a new skill

To add a skill to lettabot:

1. Create a directory under `skills/<name>/` (in the lettabot repo root) with a `SKILL.md` file. The frontmatter declares metadata (see above). The body is a prompt loaded into the agent's context -- write it as instructions the agent will follow, not as human documentation.
2. Place any executables or scripts alongside `SKILL.md` in the same directory. These become available on the agent's PATH at runtime.
3. If the skill should be feature-gated (only installed when a config flag is set), add an entry to `FEATURE_SKILLS` in `src/skills/loader.ts` and wire up the corresponding config flag in `main.ts`.
4. Verify with `lettabot skills status` that the skill is discovered and eligible.

For project-local skills that don't ship with lettabot, place them in `.skills/<name>/` instead.
